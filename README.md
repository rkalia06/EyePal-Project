# EyePal-Project
Mobile app project

Navigation to: EyePal-Project/app/src/main/java/com/example/a1/ will display the java and kotlin files used to code the "logic" of the app.
Navigation to: res/layout will display the XML files used to code the "appearance" of the app.

Extensive app design pre-planning was done in figma to ensure smooth and intentional user experience.
